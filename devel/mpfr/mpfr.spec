%description
The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with correct rounding. MPFR has continuously been supported by the
INRIA and the current main authors come from the Caramba and AriC project-teams
at Loria (Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France) respectively. MPFR is based on
the GMP multiple-precision library.
