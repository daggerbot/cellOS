%description
GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. There is no practical
limit to the precision except the ones implied by the available memory in the
machine GMP runs on. GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a
regular interface.
