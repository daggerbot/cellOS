%description
Bash is the GNU Project's shell--the Bourne Again SHell. This is an sh-
compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh)
and the C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO
9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for
both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run
by Bash without modification.
