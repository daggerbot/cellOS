%description
Zstandard is a fast compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios.
It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression.
The reference library offers a very wide range of speed / compression
trade-off, and is backed by an extremely fast decoder (see benchmarks below).
Zstandard library is provided as open source software using a BSD license. Its
format is stable and published as IETF RFC 8478.
