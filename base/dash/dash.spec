%description
The Debian Almquist Shell, also known as dash, is a simple POSIX shell derived
from the Almquist Shell. The shell program is renamed to /bin/sh in this
package, making it the system default shell for script execution. dash is
significantly faster than bash for this purpose, but it lacks most of the
features that make bash more suitable as an interactive shell.
