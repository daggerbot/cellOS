%description
The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system and
GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel.
These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD,
OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as
open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt,
login, exit and more.
