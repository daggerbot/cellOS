%description
The vi editor is one of the most common text editors on Unix. It was developed
starting around 1976 by Bill Joy at UCB, who was tired of the ed editor. But
since he used ed as a code base, access to the original sources has required a
commercial Unix Source Code License for more than twenty years. In January
2002, Caldera was so kind to remove usage restrictions to the Ancient Unix Code
by a BSD-style license (see the announcement at Slashdot) and thus vi is now
finally free.
