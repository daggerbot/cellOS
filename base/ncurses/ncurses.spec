%description
The ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of curses in
System V Release 4.0 (SVr4), and more. It uses terminfo format, supports pads
and color and multiple highlights and forms characters and function-key mapping,
and has all the other SVr4-curses enhancements over BSD curses. SVr4 curses
became the basis of X/Open Curses.
